2. **Find the Most Profitable Product Line for Each Branch**
   - Analyze gross income and cost of goods sold to identify profitability.
3. **Segment Customers Based on Spending**
   - Classify customers into tiers: High, Medium, and Low spenders.
4. **Detect Anomalies in Sales Transactions**
   - Identify unusually high or low sales to flag anomalies.
5. **Determine the Most Popular Payment Method by City**
   - Analyze transaction frequencies for each payment method across cities.
6. **Analyze Monthly Sales Distribution by Gender**
   - Study sales trends between male and female customers on a monthly basis.
7. **Identify the Best Product Line by Customer Type**
   - Compare sales preferences between members and non-members.
8. **Identify Repeat Customers**
   - Detect customers with multiple purchases within a short timeframe.
9. **Find Top 5 Customers by Sales Volume**
   - Recognize Walmart‚Äôs top revenue contributors.
10. **Analyze Sales Trends by Day of the Week**
    - Identify the days with the highest sales.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
- **MySQL**: Advanced SQL techniques for data querying and analysis.
- **PowerPoint**: For visualizing insights and presenting findings.
- **Dataset**: Contains transactional data, including branch, product line, customer demographics, and payment methods.

## üìà Key Insights
- **Branch Performance**: Branch A showed a 26.12% growth rate in March 2019, indicating effective strategies.
- **Profitability**: Negative profits across all branches highlight the need for cost control or price adjustments.

- **Anomalies**: Specific sales transactions were flagged for further investigation to mitigate fraud or errors.
- **Payment Preferences**: Ewallet is dominant in Mandalay and Yangon, while cash is preferred in Naypyitaw.
- **Gender Trends**: Balanced contributions in January, with targeted campaigns recommended for other months.
- **Top Customers**: Rewarding high-value customers like Customer 8 ($26,634.34) can enhance loyalty.
- **Sales Trends**: Saturdays lead in sales, offering an opportunity for promotions on high-performing days.
